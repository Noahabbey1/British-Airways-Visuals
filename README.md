## Data Extraction

The **import mode** was used to extract our dataset which was in a csv format, we selected the **text/csv** option under the **get data** menu in the home tab. The CSV file was then located and chosen.

## Data Transformation
To ensure data quality and also making sure our analysis addresses the business issues, we need to transform the data and perform **data wrangling** , irrelivant records or columns can also be removed to optimise the performance of the dashboard during a schedule refresh.
![](transform_data.PNG)
The following transformations were applied
1.	the data set was renamed 
2.	Promote the headers
![](promote_headers.png)

3.	To enable us carry out trend analysis, we also needed to change the date format but before changing the datatype, we needed to adjust each entry by removing the suffixes after each days i.e 1st becomes 1.
This was done on the **transform tab**, the same step was replicated with **nd**,**rd** and **th**. Although, there was a problem with the entry **August**, it was affected due to the **st** in front of it, therefore, I replaced **Augu** with **August** yet again.

4.	I then changed the data type to date and replaced error with null. All these happened on the **Transform** Tab and clicking on **replace values/ errors**
![](replace_null.PNG)

5.	There were also inconsistencies in the entries under the **route** column such as some **airports** being abbreviated and others were not, so to maintain **consistency**, the abbreviated values were replaced with their actual airport names, as you can see from the picture, **LHR**was replaced with **Heathrow** and others.

6.	We also realised that the column **country** had some incorrect entries due to customers input of unrelated answer to the column, I realised that the **length of those wrong entries** were higher than most **countries name** in the column, so I had to get the **length** of the **trimmed values** from the **add column tab** and subsequently added a **conditional column** called **new_country** on the condition that any length greater than 25 should be empty while the values whose length are lesser or equal should be left untouched. Some **date value** were also removed.

7.	We also observed that the **seat_type** had invalid entries as well, so we adopted the conditional column to make the invalid entries blank as seen in the screen shot.

:----------------------------------:|:----------------------------:

8.	The same applies to the **recommend** column which is asking customers if they will recommend BA **(From the data dictionary)**. A conditional column was used again to make invalid columns blank.
   
9.	The **satisfaction level** was created from the **stars** column which ranged from 1-9, this was then categorised from **very dissatisfied to very satisfied**.

## Analysis and Visualization

Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) functions were used to perform the following analysis:

**Calculating the total number of valid customer reviews.**

Total Customer Review = COUNTA(British_Airway_Review[reviews])

**Determining the average star rating.**
The DAX expression was written as AVG star rating = AVERAGEA(British_Airway_Review[stars]) then the **guage visual** was used to display the rating, the **guage** was the preferred visual because it helps in displaying the **minimum and maximum values** with the average value which is **4.29**. 

For an appealing and relatable navigation, a black background was selected from the **canvas background** followed by rectangular shapes of proportionate sizes where each visuals will fit in.

## Dashboard

## Discussion
üëé Alarming discovery: 64.53% of customers wouldn't recommend BA due to their experience, and this percentage has been declining over the years. In 2015, over 50% said they would recommend, but it has since dropped below 50% and got to a staggering . The Donut chart was used to display this with data labels that shows executives the percentages.
the two **bookmarks** show decline of reccomendation from 2015 to 2023.

![](2023_rec.PNG)

**üåç Purpose of travel**: Passengers mostly travel for couple leisure, with other purposes being business, family leisure, and solo travel. A clustered column chart was used to visualize this.

**‚úàÔ∏è Seat types**: Most reviews come from passengers in the economy class (1310), followed by business class (720). Other seat types include premium economy and first class. Tree map was adopted for this visual. The **reccomended ratio was thesame for all seat types as all four will mostly not reccomend BA**

**‚úàÔ∏è Flight route**: the highest flight route was from Denver to London Heathrow with a total flight of 245 trips, although there was not a significant margin between those routes as seen in the dashboard. 

**üåè Passenger origin**: the matrix table indicated that majority of the customers are predominantly from the United Kingdom (1486), followed by the United States (292).

**üìà Satisfaction levels**: Ratings from 1 to 9 were used to measure satisfaction. Unfortunately, customers have consistently been dissatisfied over the eight-year period.

A **Drill through filter** was used to navigate down to **customers' comments page** from the satisfation visuals.

**üì£ Popular complaints from customers include:**
- Bad shoulder straps
- Weak Wi-Fi connections
- Limited food options
- Sub-par customer service
- Occasional server downtime leading to long queues
- Narrow seats
- Infotainment issues
- Safety instructions only in English, despite diverse passengers
- Bag handling causing significant delays

2. Near Real-Time Feedback Mechanism: Introduce a feedback mechanism integrated with infotainment systems, allowing passengers to share their experiences and grievances during their journey.

4. Continuous Improvement Culture: Foster a culture of continuous improvement within the organization. Encourage employees at all levels to contribute ideas and solutions for enhancing customer satisfaction.

5. Data Analysis Integration: Make data analysis a routine part of operations. Use data proactively to identify emerging issues and address them before they escalate.
